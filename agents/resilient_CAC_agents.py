    RESILIENT PROJECTION-BASED CONSENSUS ACTOR-CRITIC AGENT
    This is an implementation of the deep resilient projection-based consensus actor-critic (RPBCAC) algorithm from Figura et al. (2021).
    The algorithm is a realization of temporal difference learning with one-step lookahead. It is an instance of decentralized learning,
    where each agent receives its own reward and observes the global state and action. The RPBCAC agent seeks to maximize a team-average
    objective function of the cooperative agents in the presence of adversaries. The RPBCAC agent employs neural networks to approximate
    the actor, critic, and team-average reward function.

    The updates are divided into four parts.

    1) The agent performs a batch local stochastic update of the critic and team-average reward through methods critic_update_local() and TR_update_local().
    2) The agent estimates the neighbors' estimation errors via projection and applies the resilient projection-based consensus update.
    3) The agent performs a stochastic update using the mean estimation errors. This is executed by methods critic_update_team() and TR_update_team().

    The code is applicable for both online and batch training. The RCAC agent further includes method get_action() to sample actions from the policy approximated by the actor network.

    ARGUMENTS: NN models for actor, critic, and team_reward

               fast learning rate (for the critic and team reward networks)
